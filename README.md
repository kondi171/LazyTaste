# LazyTaste

An engineering application as an intermediary system between restaurant and customer.
System enabling ordering meals online. Customer system is supported by Artificial
Intelligence implemented with **brain.js**, which will recommend gastronomic meals
based on collected data. System was implemented on JavaScript engine supported
by **React.js** framework for visual layer and business logic.
Storage and segregation are supported by no-relational database â€“ **MongoDB** with
**Mongoose**. Implementation of backend is based on **Node.js** and **Express.js**
frameworks which support Javascript syntax.

## How to run?

API endpoints:

- [Opinions database](https://lazytaste-backend.onrender.com/API/opinions)

- [Customers database](https://lazytaste-backend.onrender.com/API/customers)

- [Restaurants database](https://lazytaste-backend.onrender.com/API/restaurants)

- [Lazy Assistant database](https://lazytaste-backend.onrender.com/API/lazy-assistant)

**IMPORTANT!** Due to the free hosting package, the speed of data exchange between frontend and backend is poor, patience is recommended :)

## Artificial Neural Network

The client system was supported by the implementation of the Artificial
Neural Network - **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)**. It is a recursive type of neural
network, which, unlike standard neural networks, has the possibility of feedback.
The main advantage of this type of network is the ability to process both single data
and sequences, including character strings, which are transferred to the training
data, on the basis of which the result is predicted.
